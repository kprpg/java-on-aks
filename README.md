subscription, you can activate your 
[MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) 
or sign up for a 
[free Azure account]((https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)).

In addition, you will need the following:

| [Azure CLI](http://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/overview) 
| [Java 8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu) 
| [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/) 
| [Git](https://github.com/) 
| [ACR Docker Credential Helper](https://github.com/Azure/acr-docker-credential-helper)
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/)
| [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
| [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
| [dos2unix](https://brewinstall.org/install-dos2unix-on-mac-with-brew/)
|

## IMPORTANT - Start Here

Clone this GitHub repo and change directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-on-aks.git

cd java-on-aks
```

## Create MongoDB and RabbitMQ

You can create MongoDB and RabbitMQ on Azure by following steps outlined [here](./docs/create-mongodb-and-rabbitmq.md)
and capture MongoDB and RabbitMQ coordinates and credentials in 
`setup-env-variables-azure.sh`. 

## Create Azure Container Registry and Azure Kubernetes Service

### Create Azure Container Registry
If you have not yet setup the development environment, 
make a copy of the setup environment variables bash script:
```bash
cp .scripts/setup-env-variables-azure-template.sh .scripts/setup-env-variables-azure.sh
```

Prep the dev environment by populating environment variables in 
`.scripts/setup-env-variables-azure.sh`
bash script:

```bash
# ====== Piggy Metrics Azure Coordinates
export RESOURCE_GROUP=INSERT-your-resource-group-name
export REGION=westus2
export AKS_CLUSTER=INSERT-your-AKS-cluster-name
export CONTAINER_REGISTRY=INSERT-your-Azure-Container-Registry-name

## ===== Mongo DB
export MONGODB_DATABASE=INSERT-your-mongodb-database-name
export MONGODB_USER=INSERT-your-cosmosdb-account-name
export MONGODB_URI="INSERT-your-mongodb-connection-string"
export MONGODB_RESOURCE_ID=INSERT-your-mongodb-resource-id

## ===== Rabbit MQ
export RABBITMQ_RESOURCE_GROUP=INSERT-your-rabbitmq-resource-group-name
export RABBITMQ_VM_NAME=INSERT-your-rabbitmq-virtual-machine-name
export RABBITMQ_ADMIN_USERNAME=INSERT-your-rabbitmq-admin-user-name

# Rabbit MQ
export RABBITMQ_HOST=INSERT-your-rabbitmq-host-public-ip-address
export RABBITMQ_PORT=5672
export RABBITMQ_USERNAME=INSERT-your-rabbitmq-username
export RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=INSERT-your-rabbitmq-password
```

Then, export these environment variables from the `java-on-aks` directory:

```bash
source .scripts/setup-env-variables-azure.sh
```

Create an Azure Container Registry instance using Azure CLI:
```bash
# Create a Resource Group, if you have not created one
az group create --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${REGION}
    
# Create Azure Container Registry
az acr create --name ${CONTAINER_REGISTRY} \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --sku basic --location ${REGION}
    
# Log into Azure Container Registry
az acr login -n ${CONTAINER_REGISTRY}

```

### Create Azure Kubernetes Service

Create an Azure Kubernetes Service instance and attach the Azure Container Registry using Azure CLI:
```bash
az aks create --name ${AKS_CLUSTER} \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${REGION} \
    --attach-acr ${CONTAINER_REGISTRY} \
    --node-vm-size Standard_DS3_v2 \
    --node-count 5
```

Get access credentials for the AKS cluster:
```bash
az aks get-credentials --name ${AKS_CLUSTER} \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
```

### Auto instrument for monitoring Java apps on Azure Kubernetes Service

If you do not have an instance of Application Insights, see
 [how to create Application Insights](./docs/create-application-insights.md).

Download Java agent ([download link](https://github.com/microsoft/Application-Insights-K8s-Codeless-Attach/releases))
for auto instrumenting for monitoring Java apps on an Azure Kubernetes Service.

From a Linux or MacOS terminal, execute init.sh from the release.

```bash
source init.sh
```

Open the generated `values.yaml` file in an editor and fill up Kubernetes Cluster
 target namespace, say `default`, and Application Insights `Instrumentation Key`. Like this:
 
```yaml
namespaces: 
  - target : "default" # kubernetes namespace where the Java apps will be auto-instrumented
    iKey: "c197cf6b-WWWW-XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZZZZZZZZZ" # Instrumentation Key of the receiving Application Insights resource
```

Install the Java agent for auto instrumentation:
```bash
helm install ./helm-<version>.tgz -f values.yaml --generate-name
```

## Deploy Piggymetrics to Azure Kubernetes Service

### Build and push container images for micro service apps

Build Java apps, container images and push images to Azure Container Registry
using Maven and [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin):
 
```bash
cd config
mvn compile jib:build \
    -Djib.container.environment=CONFIG_SERVICE_PASSWORD=${CONFIG_SERVICE_PASSWORD}

cd ../registry
mvn compile jib:build

cd ../gateway
mvn compile jib:build

cd ../auth-service
mvn compile jib:build

cd ../account-service
mvn compile jib:build \
    -Djib.container.environment=ACCOUNT_SERVICE_PASSWORD=${ACCOUNT_SERVICE_PASSWORD}

cd ../statistics-service
mvn compile jib:build \
    -Djib.container.environment=STATISTICS_SERVICE_PASSWORD=${STATISTICS_SERVICE_PASSWORD}

cd ../notification-service
mvn compile jib:build \
    -Djib.container.environment=NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_PASSWORD=${NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_PASSWORD}

```

Jib is configured to start from a production-ready distribution of Java. For example:
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>jib-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.8.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <from>
            <!-- production-ready distribution of Java -->
            <image>mcr.microsoft.com/java/jre-headless:8u232-zulu-alpine</image>
        </from>
        <to>
            <image>${CONTAINER_REGISTRY}.azurecr.io/${parent.artifactId}-${project.name}</image>
        </to>
        <container>
            <jvmFlags>
                <jvmFlag>-Xms2048m</jvmFlag>
                <jvmFlag>-Xmx2048m</jvmFlag>
            </jvmFlags>
            <ports>
                <port>${CONFIG_PORT}</port>
            </ports>
            <labels>
                <key1>${project.version}</key1>
            </labels>
        </container>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### Prepare Kubernetes manifest files

Prepare Kubernetes manifest files using the supplied `bash` script:

```bash
# cd to kubernetes folder
cd ../kubernetes
source ../.scripts/prepare-kubernetes-manifest-files.sh

```
### Create Secrets in Kubernetes

You can create Secrets for deploying micro service apps in Kubernetes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/0-secrets.yaml

# you can view Secrets in Kubernetes using:
kubectl get secret piggymetrics -o yaml
```

### Deploy Spring Cloud Config Server

You can deploy the Spring Cloud Config Server to Kubernetes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/1-config.yaml
```

### Deploy Spring Cloud Service Registry

You can deploy the Spring Cloud Service Registry to Kubernetes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/2-registry.yaml
```

You can validate that a Spring Cloud Config Server is up and running by
invoking its REST API.

The Spring Cloud Config Server REST API has resources in the following form:

```bash
/{application}/{profile}[/{label}]
/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{application}-{profile}.properties
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.properties
```

You can get IP addresses of Spring Cloud Config Server and Spring Cloud Service Registry 
using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
config       LoadBalancer   10.0.34.171   51.143.50.77    8888:31892/TCP   3m15s
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.0.0.1      <none>          443/TCP          3h42m
registry     LoadBalancer   10.0.198.13   52.137.96.211   8761:31689/TCP   6s
```

Try:
```bash
open http://<EXTERNAL-IP-of-config>:8888/gateway/profile
open http://<EXTERNAL-IP-of-config>:8888/account-service/profile
open http://<EXTERNAL-IP-of-config>:8888/statistics-service/profile
open http://<EXTERNAL-IP-of-config>:8888/notification-service/profile
...
open http://<EXTERNAL-IP-of-config>:8888/notification-service/profile/development
...
```

![](./media/spring-cloud-config-server-running-in-kubernetes.jpg)

You can validate that a Spring Cloud Service Registry is up and running by 
opening the Service Registry Dashboard:

```bash
open http://<EXTERNAL-IP-of-registry>:8761/
```

![](./media/spring-cloud-service-registry-running-in-kubernetes-01.jpg)

### Deploy Spring Cloud Gateway

You can deploy the Spring Cloud Gateway to Kubernetes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/3-gateway.yaml
```

### Deploy 4 Spring Cloud micro service apps 

You can deploy Spring Cloud micro service apps to Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/4-auth-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/5-account-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/6-statistics-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/7-notification-service.yaml
```

You can validate that Spring Cloud middleware components and micro service apps are running:

```bash
kubectl get services
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
account-service        ClusterIP      10.0.215.174   <none>          6000/TCP         108s
auth-service           ClusterIP      10.0.164.45    <none>          5000/TCP         2m26s
config                 LoadBalancer   10.0.34.171    51.143.50.77    8888:31892/TCP   24m
gateway                LoadBalancer   10.0.154.13    52.143.88.12    80:31412/TCP     4m3s
kubernetes             ClusterIP      10.0.0.1       <none>          443/TCP          4h3m
notification-service   ClusterIP      10.0.169.231   <none>          8000/TCP         63s
registry               LoadBalancer   10.0.198.13    52.137.96.211   8761:31689/TCP   21m
statistics-service     ClusterIP      10.0.217.229   <none>          7000/TCP         76s
```

You can also validate that by 
opening the Spring Cloud Service Registry Dashboard

```bash
open http://<EXTERNAL-IP-of-registry>:8761/
```
![](./media/spring-cloud-service-registry-running-in-kubernetes-02.jpg)

### Open Spring Cloud micro service apps running on Kubernetes

Open the Piggymetrics landing page by using the`gateway` app's `EXTERNAL-IP`.

```bash
open http://<EXTERNAL-IP-of-gateway>/
```

For example: 

![](./media/piggy-metrics-first-page.jpg)

![](./media/piggy-metrics-second-page.jpg)

![](./media/piggy-metrics-third-page.jpg)

![](./media/piggy-metrics-fourth-page.jpg)

## Troubleshooting micro service apps in Azure Kubernetes Service

With out-of-the-box support for aggregating logs, metrics, and 
distributed app traces into Azure Monitor, you can easily visualize 
how your applications are performing, detect and diagnose issues 
across micro service applications and their dependencies, drill 
into monitoring data for troubleshooting and gain better 
understanding of what end-users do with your apps.

### Debug in development machine
You can run Spring Cloud Config, Spring Cloud Service Registry, 
Spring Cloud Gateway and other Spring Cloud components on their dev machine. 
You can attach debuggers to Spring Cloud micro service apps and step through them. You can 
look at logs and metrics. Use Java Flight Recorder, etc.

### Stream logs from micro service apps in cloud to development machines
You can stream logs from micro service apps running on Kubernetes to your 
development machine using `kubectl`, like:
```bash
# Stream logs from Spring Cloud Config Server
kubectl logs -f --timestamps=true -l app=config

# Stream logs from Spring Cloud Service Registry
kubectl logs -f --timestamps=true -l app=registry

# Stream logs from Spring Cloud Gateway
kubectl logs -f --timestamps=true -l app=gateway

# Stream logs from Spring Cloud micro service apps
kubectl logs -f --timestamps=true -l app=auth-service
kubectl logs -f --timestamps=true -l app=account-service
kubectl logs -f --timestamps=true -l app=statistics-service
kubectl logs -f --timestamps=true -l app=notification-service
```

### Use aggregated logs and metrics in Azure Log Analytics

You can aggregate logs in Azure Log Analytics and retrieve them 
using Kusto queries. If you do not have a Log Analytics Workspace in Azure, 
see [how to create a Log Analytics Workspace](./docs/create-log-analytics.md)

You can onboard your Kubernetes cluster to Azure Monitor for monitoring, by clicking
on the `Logs` blade in the Azure Portal and choosing your Log Analytics Workspace:

![](./media/onboard-kubernetes-cluster-to-azure-monitor.jpg)


Then, you can view logs using Kusto queries in the `Logs` blade of your 
Log Analytics Workspace:
![](./media/view-logs-in-log-analytics-workspace.jpg)

Here are some sample Kusto queries for viewing logs for each of the micro service apps -
please replace `java-on-aks` with your Azure Kubernetes cluster name:

```sql
-- Logs for Spring Cloud Config Server
let ContainerIdList = KubePodInventory
| where ContainerName contains 'config'
| where ClusterId contains 'java-on-aks'
| distinct ContainerID;
ContainerLog
| where ContainerID in (ContainerIdList)
| where LogEntry !contains "AI:" 
| project LogEntrySource, LogEntry, TimeGenerated, Computer, Image, Name, ContainerID
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| render table


-- Logs for Spring Cloud Service Registry
let ContainerIdList = KubePodInventory
| where ContainerName contains 'registry'
| where ClusterId contains 'java-on-aks'
| distinct ContainerID;
ContainerLog
| where ContainerID in (ContainerIdList)
| where LogEntry !contains "AI:" 
| project LogEntrySource, LogEntry, TimeGenerated, Computer, Image, Name, ContainerID
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| render table


-- Logs for Spring Cloud Gateway
let ContainerIdList = KubePodInventory
| where ContainerName contains 'gateway'
| where ClusterId contains 'java-on-aks'
| distinct ContainerID;
ContainerLog
| where ContainerID in (ContainerIdList)
| where LogEntry !contains "AI:" 
| project LogEntrySource, LogEntry, TimeGenerated, Computer, Image, Name, ContainerID
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| render table


-- Logs for Account Service micro service app
let ContainerIdList = KubePodInventory
| where ContainerName contains 'account-service'
| where ClusterId contains 'java-on-aks'
| distinct ContainerID;
ContainerLog
| where ContainerID in (ContainerIdList)
| where LogEntry !contains "AI:" 
| project LogEntrySource, LogEntry, TimeGenerated, Computer, Image, Name, ContainerID
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| render table


-- Logs for Auth Service micro service app
let ContainerIdList = KubePodInventory
| where ContainerName contains 'auth-service'
| where ClusterId contains 'java-on-aks'
| distinct ContainerID;
ContainerLog
| where ContainerID in (ContainerIdList)
| where LogEntry !contains "AI:" 
| project LogEntrySource, LogEntry, TimeGenerated, Computer, Image, Name, ContainerID
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| render table

```
### Use Application Insights to monitor your micro service apps

You can use Application Insights to monitor your live web application. It will 
automatically detect performance anomalies. It includes powerful analytics tools to 
help you diagnose issues and to understand what users actually do with your app. It is designed to 
help you continuously improve performance and usability.

After some time, you can see distributed tracing in the 
configured Application Insights instance. Go to the `Application Map' blade in the Azure Portal:
![](./media/distributed-tracing.jpg)

Also, you can view the performance and call drill downs in the `Performance` blade:
![](./media/view-performance-in-app-insights.jpg)

## Automate and rapidly deploy changes to Azure Kubernetes Service - GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines

Create an Azure Pipelines CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds the code and deploys it to the Azure Kubernetes Cluster whenever there's a commit to the repository.

### Prerequisites

There are some additional prerequisites for this automation:

- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
- [Azure DevOps Organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-sign-up?view=azure-devops)
- [Environment with AKS resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments-kubernetes?view=azure-devops#azure-kubernetes-service) which creates a service account in the chosen cluster and namespace, which will be used by Azure DevOps account to deploy to AKS
- [Azure service connection using service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-with-an-existing-service-principal) to establish authentication between Azure & Azure DevOps services
> [!Important]
   > To simplify the service connection, use the same email address for Azure DevOps as you use for Azure.
- Create an Azure KeyVault and upload secrets. Ensure the service principal used in the service connection above has GET, LIST [permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/keyvault?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-set-policy) on the vault. Use below command for that:
```
az keyvault set-policy -n $KV_NAME --secret-permissions get list --spn <clientId from the Azure SPN JSON>
```  
 
### Azure Pipelines

1. Sign into Azure Pipelines and Create a Pipeline using the [`azure-pipelines.yml`](./azure-pipelines.yml) file. 

2. Take a look at the pipeline to see what it does. Make sure that all the default inputs are appropriate for your code.

    The azure-pipelines.yml file contains the following key elements:

    - The `trigger` at the top indicates the commits that trigger the pipeline, such as commits to the `master` branch.
    - The `variables` which parameterize the YAML template
    - The `stages`
       - Build `stage`, which builds your app, and a Deploy `stage`, which deploys it to AKS cluster.
       - Deploy `stage` also refers the Environment with Kubernetes resource. Ensure to modify the environment name to the one that you have created.
    - [AzureKeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/deploy/azure-key-vault?view=azure-devops) task is used in both the stages to fetch the secrets from Azure Key Vault instance and set as variables. In the `Deploy` stage, these variables are used to set secrets in the pods.
    - [Kubernetes Manifest task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/deploy/kubernetes-manifest?view=azure-devops) has the added benefits of being able to check for object stability before marking a task as success/failure, perform artifact substitution, add pipeline traceability-related annotations onto deployed objects, simplify creation and referencing of imagePullSecrets

    ![](./media/azure-pipelines-01.jpg)

3. After you've looked at what the pipeline does, select Save and run, after which you're prompted for a commit message because Azure Pipelines adds the azure-pipelines.yml file to your repository. After editing the message, select Save and run again to see your pipeline in action.

4. As your pipeline runs, watch as your build stage, and then your deployment stage, go from blue (running) to green (completed). You can select the stages and jobs to watch your pipeline in action.

    ![](./media/azure-pipelines-02.jpg) 

5. Additionally, you can also explore Kubernetes objects created and the deployment history for the App by navigating to the "**Environment**". 
    - From the pipeline **summary** -> Select the **Environments** tab -> Select **View environment**
    - **Resources** view within the environment provides a glimpse of the status of objects within the namespace mapped to the resource. It also overlays pipeline traceability on top of these objects so that one can trace back from a Kubernetes object to the pipeline and then back to the commit.

    ![](./media/azure-pipelines-03.jpg) 

### GitHub Actions

You can also configure a 
[Workflow to automate build and deploy](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow) 
in GitHub 
using the [`workflow.yml`](./.github/workflows/workflow.yml). 

- Create secrets for every parameter in `.scripts/setup-env-variables-azure-template.sh`.
    - Set [GitHub Repo Secrets](https://aka.ms/create-secrets-for-GitHub-workflows) AZURE_CREDENTIALS, AKS_CLUSTER_NAME, AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP and AKS_NAMESPACE with Azure creds, AKS cluster name, resource group name and namespace
    - For configuring App secrets, You could either set them as [GitHub Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) or fetch them from an Azure Key Vault instance.
- `workflow.yml` contains the following key elements:

    - The `on: [push]` at the top indicates the commits that trigger the pipeline, such as every commit to the branch.
    - The `env:` with variables which parameterize the YAML template
    - The `jobs` : Build `job`, which builds your app, and a Deploy `job`, which deploys it to AKS cluster. Each job has `steps` which either `uses` an `action` or `run` a script, all of which execute on a hosted-runner defined by `runs-on`.
    - [AzureKeyVault](https://github.com/Azure/get-keyvault-secrets) action is used in both the jobs to fetch the secrets from Azure Key Vault instance and set as environment variables. In the `Deploy` job, these variables are used to set secrets in the pods.
    - [Actions to deploy to AKS](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/master/Kubernetes) are then used to create imagepullsecret, set secrets on pods and finally to deploy to AKS cluster.

## Congratulations and Next Steps to Production

Congratulations!! 

You built, deployed, scaled out and setup monitoring for Spring Cloud micro service apps
using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Container Registry,
Azure Monitor, Log Analytics and Application Insights.

To advance Java deployments on Kubernetes to production, you should think 
about the following next steps:
- Frame a scalable infrastructure with Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Container Registry
to satisfy your deployments' business and technical requirements. See [Microservices architecture on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/microservices/aks)
- Frame a plan to assume infrastructure management -- including load balancers, clustering, 
security, SSL offloading, domain name mapping, etc.
- Define an application lifecyle for apps on Azure Kubernetes Service and use them
 across developer and DevOps automation tools. This lifecyle should include a 
 source-to-container strategy
- Frame a plan to assume service management -- including configuration, managing secrets, backup & restore, 
monitoring & log shipping, upgrades, auto-restart, auto-scale or manual-scale, etc. If you are deploying 
Spring Cloud micro service apps, service management should include 
strategies for manually or dynamically scaling Spring Cloud middleware components - 
Spring Cloud Config Server,
Spring Cloud Service Registry, Spring Cloud Gateway, etc.
